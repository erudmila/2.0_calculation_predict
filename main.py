# Add comments to this code to predict what it will do.
print(8 + 2) # will add 8 + 2 and output 10

print( 8 - 2) # will subtract 8 - 2 and output 6

print(8 * 2) # will multiply 8 and 2 and output 16

print(10 / 4) # will divide 10/4 output ~2.5

print(10 // 4) # will divide 10/4 but putput only the whole part 

# This code uses variables in place of numbers in the calculation. Add comments to 
# explain how it works.

num1 = 20 # creates a variable to hold an interger = 20
num2 = 5 #crates a variable to hold an interger = 5

result = num1 * num2 #will multiply 2 intergers and it wil store the calculation in a 
# variable called result.

print(result) # it will output to the console the value store in the result variable

# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it 
# works.

print("Enter a number") #it will output "enter a number" on the console 
num1 = int(input()) #creates a varibale & will assign for an interger, be input by user
num2 = 2 #it will assign the alue integet 2 to the variable num2

result = num1 // num2 #the integral division of num1 and num2 will be store in a v
#variable called result
# if i were to enter 5 the result of the dividion would have been 2.5 but it would 
# output the interger part of the number
print(result) # it will out to console the value store  the result

# after the code was ran i did not predict that the result will be 100 since num1 is 20 
#and num2 is 5 when you multiply it gives you 100
